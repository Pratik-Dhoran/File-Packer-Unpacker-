### About :
  - This project provides the facility of packing and unpacking the regular files.
  - In case of packing activity all the data of multiple regular files get stored in single file with all related metadata.
  - In case of unpacking activity the data from the packed file gets extracted in the separate file with all necessary details.
  - To maintain the security of the data we provide encryption and decryption techniques.
  - We provide Graphical user interface to interact with the application.
